New emotional mnemonic discrimination task


Task Overview
This novel emotional mnemonic discrimination task is designed to assess memory specificity and pattern separation for emotionally salient and neutral stimuli. The task has two parallel subsets: Subset A and Subset B
Both sets have been thoroughly balanced, piloted, and matched for difficulty. Each subset includes trials assessing participants’ ability to distinguish between targets, lures, and foils across varying emotional valences.
Because Subsets A and B are equivalently challenging and psychometrically matched, this task is ideal for intervention studies or within-subjects/repeated measures designs, as the alternate forms can help minimize learning effects and reduce interference from prior exposures. Each subset is designed to produce memory performance patterns consistent with those observed in the original Emotional Mnemonic Discrimination Task.

Key Features
Two balanced and counterbalanced stimulus sets (A and B)

Each set contains matched proportions of emotional (positive, negative) and neutral stimuli
The emotional scene stimuli included in this task are culturally inclusive, reflect current societal contexts, and generalizable. 
Designed for repeated use in longitudinal or pre/post designs

Normed for visual similarity and emotional valence
Allows for comparisons of memory performance for emotional vs. neutral content

Tasks include target, lure, and foil stimuli for mnemonic discrimination assessment

Compatible with behavioral or fMRI studies

Recommendations

Task A and B can be used interchangeably. If you are measuring an intervention (pre- and post-), we recommend counterbalancing the initial vs second task across participants to reduce order effects.

Ensure similar testing conditions across sessions to maintain consistency.

The task is coded for a 20 inch screen. Some edits may need to be done to the task if using a different resolution
Similarly, all images are sized to 600px. Images can be resized smaller or different according to screen display needs

Make sure to download the task folder into the desktop of the computer you will be using. This will ensure the task runs smoothly and doesn’t require an internet connection to run (helps avoid crashes).

Task Structure

Task A has a total of 226 stimuli, Task B uses 227 stimuli. Both tasks are separated into an encoding (study) and retrieval (memory test) stage. 
Study Phase: Participants view and encode emotional and neutral images.

Test Phase: Participants complete a mnemonic discrimination test where they must classify items as "Old" (targets) or "New" (foils/lures).

Task Software

The task is built in Psychopy (Version 2023.1.2).


Stimulus Subset Details

All stimuli have been pilot-tested for:
Recognition accuracy, false alarm and lure rejection rates

Subjective emotional ratings (valence/arousal)

Visual complexity and semantic similarity
